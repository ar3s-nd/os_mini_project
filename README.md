# Project Setup Instructions

This project includes the following scripts to help you get started:

1. **`server.sh`**  
   Use this script to start the server. Ensure the server is running before interacting with the client. Logs will be made in db/logs.txt.

   ```bash
   bash server.sh
   ```

2. **`init.sh`**  
   Run this script to initialize the database files with dummy values. It sets up the necessary data for the project to function correctly.

   ```bash
   bash init.sh
   ```

3. **`client.sh`**  
   Run this script to execute the client-side code and interact with the server.
   ```bash
   bash client.sh
   ```
